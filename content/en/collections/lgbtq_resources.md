## Some FAQs

### Do I have to have dysphoria to be trans?

Nope. You don't need *any* dysphoria to be trans. If you want to be a gender? That's all you need.

Just ask: Are you more comfortable living your life as a gender?

### Do I have to medically transition to be trans?

No. You do not have to medically transition - The belief that you must transition is actually gatekeeping and is harmful - This specific gatekeeping is known as transmedicalism.

### Can I change course if I realize I'm something else?

Yes. You can change course if you realize you're something else (or perhaps cis after all). It's okay to change your mind.

### What is plurality/multiplicity?

Plural is a term used to describe systems of multiple people in one body, put simply.
While they *might* not be LGBTQ+ by default, they are often included in LGBTQ+ spaces due to the discrimination they face. It is important to respect their identities and pronouns.
I also include information on plurality in this list because it is important to understand and respect plural systems.

If you've watched Yu Yu Hakusho, think of Sensui and his multiple personalities.

Here's a site that contains some quick information: [MoreThanOne.info](http://morethanone.info/)

### What is a therian?

A therian is someone who identifies as a non-human animal on a spiritual or psychological level. They are not LGBTQ+ by default, but they are often included in LGBTQ+ spaces due to the discrimination they face. It's important to respect them as well.

I think I'll need to research more on this topic before I can provide that much more info.

### Directly LGBTQ+ Stories

> Charon's sister dressed him up as a girl, and he liked it. This is her story, learning about who she is, and slowly realizing and becoming her true self, along with her friends and family. Updates on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.... most of the time.

- [Guilty Gear Strive](https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/) (Bridget's story)

> Bridget is a character in the Guilty Gear series. Though born male, because of a myth in her hometown, she was raised female, and wanted to disprove the myth and prove herself as a man at the time. After successfully doing so, she realized she was more comfortable a woman after all.
You may have heard some bigots claiming that it was mistranslation - No, it was fully intended by the devs, and the japanese version clearly states that she's a girl.

### Indirectly LGBTQ+ Stories/Resonant

> The game's lead developer also realized she was trans whilst working on the final chapter of the game, she now goes by Maddy (full name Madeline Stephanie Thorson), she/her.
